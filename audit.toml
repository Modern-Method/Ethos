# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack timing side-channel in `rsa` crate
# Status: IGNORED — not applicable
# Reason: `rsa 0.9.10` appears in Cargo.lock as a stale transitive entry via
#   sqlx-mysql, but sqlx-mysql is NOT in our active dependency tree
#   (we use sqlx with default-features=false, postgres-only).
#   `cargo tree -i rsa` and `cargo tree -i sqlx-mysql` both return empty.
#   The rsa crate is never compiled into our binaries.
#   No fix is available upstream; this advisory can be safely ignored for
#   our use case. Re-evaluate if we ever add MySQL support.
# Date ignored: 2026-02-22
